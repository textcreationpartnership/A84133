            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Iving him to underſtand the occaſion of this that followeth, which was, firſt upon ſome little ſpeech had with three or foure of theſe Anabaptiſts, about their opinions and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, ſome of them ſaying they could bring men who had as ſufficient gifts and authoritie from God to preach and baptize, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> had, <hi>Acts 2.</hi> To which ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was replied, That if they could bring ſuch a one, he was worthy to be hearkned unto. And they anſwered, That they could bring many ſuch. And it was replied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, One ſuch a one would be ſufficient. So that he were one of the beſt and moſt able.</p>
            <p>And ſo the time and place being appointed, there came divers of them, whereof one ſate him down at the Tables end, as to be the chiefe ſpeaker.</p>
            <p>So it was told him what ſome had ſaid, and he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, if he did profeſſe ſo much of himſelfe, or no; which he did ſeem in part to deny: But yet profeſſed, that he had as good ground and authority from God for that which he undertook to do and practiſe, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> had for that which he did.</p>
            <p>And ſo hereupon ſome ſpeeches paſſed between us touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rule for baptizing: and the firſt principle or ground-work affirmed by <hi>T.L.</hi> was, that every one muſt firſt have juſtifying faith, and profeſſe the ſame to the baptizer, and he
<pb facs="tcp:155141:3"/>
ſo judge of him before he might be baptized.</p>
            <p>Which was oppoſed and anſwered, That the receiving of the word gladly, was ſufficient for outward Baptiſme, though juſtifying faith were yet wanting. The queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning men and women of yeares.</p>
            <p>But <hi>T. L.</hi> was (by ſome of his company) haſtned away, becauſe many people ſtaid at his houſe, as they ſaid, to hear him preach that evening; by which means our Speech was broken off, and he went his way.</p>
            <p>So upon theſe occaſions the arguments which follow, were written and ſent him, and he hath returned his anſwers unto them; unto which anſwers replies are alſo made. And ſome arguments after them, to prove that little children may lawfully, according to the rule of the word of God, be baptized.</p>
            <p>And alſo a brief declaration what the true reformation is and ſhall be, farre exceeding in ſpirituall and heavenly reſpects, the corrupt conceits of theſe Anabaptiſts, and all other ſuch like earthly and carnall builders. And who the two witneſſes of God are, by whoſe meanes chiefly it is to be performed. All which I referre to the conſideration of the judicious Reader; deſiring of God, that he would give him his holy Spirit of truth to lead him into all truth. And ſo I reſt</p>

                     <p>This diſtinction of <hi>T.

                     <p>And although they could not follow him in the meaſure and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his knowledge, he being God, and knowing all things; yet as he knew how to diſtinguiſh and put a difference between ſuch as gladly received his word, and ſo farre became his diſciples, fitted to be entertained into the outward ſtate of the Church by outward Baptiſme, and this kind of beleeving; and ſuch as afterward by a more excellent gift of the Spirit, did eate his fleſh, and drink his blood, beleeve in him unto juſtification and life: So he gave gifts to his Apoſtles, and ſuch as he ſent, whereby they were able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and diſtinguiſh between perſons and perſons, between faith and faith; and knew that they which gladly received the word, were to be baptized, though yet wanting juſtifying faith. And ſo according to Chriſts example, through the grace and gift given them, they practiſed, as <hi>Act.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12.13. where they baptized ſuch, of whom ſome fell away, as alſo ſome of them did whom Chriſt baptized, and ſome continued, having obtained a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent pretious faith, by a more excellent and more peculiar gift of of the Spirit, as is evident by <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.66, 67, 68, 69. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.31, 32, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.2, 3. &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.15, 16, 17, 18.19.20.</p>

he having perfect knowledge, would himſelfe have baptized none but ſuch onely, and would have given ſtraight charge to his Miniſters (as <hi>Paul</hi> did in another caſe to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man</hi>) ſo unto them, Beware that ye baptize no man ſuddenly, but ſtay till he ſhew that pretious faith by his works, and words of his mouth, proceeding from the good treaſure of his heart, which is the fruit whereby ye ſhall know it and him alſo, that his heart is purified by that faith, and then baptize him.

                  <p>If Chriſt or his Apoſtles had taken it for granted, that all whoſoever they baptized, had before it eaten Chriſts fleſh, and drunk his blood, beleeved in him unto juſtification and life; had received his Spirit of adoption, and ſo judged of them; Then did they contradict their owne judgements in ſaying to ſome of them ſo ſoon after, <hi>Except ye

                     <head>The Anſwer of T. L.</head>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, firſt, that ſome of your Scriptures quoted, prove not your propoſition; becauſe that although a man have juſtifying faith, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may ſay unto him, <hi>Except yee eate the fleſh of the Sonne of Man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> And this may be ſaid to him alſo, <hi>He that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that neither Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles, did require a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be baptized, but ſuch as did profeſſe they had juſtifying faith: and therefore if there were any contradiction, it was in them that did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to have juſtifying faith, and had it not, and not in Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, That although Chriſt did not take it for granted, nor ſo judge of all that were admitted to baptiſme to have juſtifying faith, when they were admitted; becauſe he had power to diſcerne above the rule given to the Miniſters of Baptiſme; yet the Apoſtles did, at the time when they were received to baptiſme, though afterward ſome did diſcover themſelves deſtitute thereof. And therefore it was the rule.</p>

                     <p>To the firſt, where <hi>T. L.</hi> denieth ſome of the Scriptures quoted, to prove the propoſition, and allowing the reſt, he thereby grants the propoſition proved, but the places he excepts againſt, prove it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: For if Chriſt had ſo judged, and taken it for granted, then he would not himſelfe have ſaid, <hi>Except yee eate the fleſh of the Sonne of of Man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.

So that theſe places as well as the reſt, doe prove the Propoſition true. That
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155141:5"/>
if they had ſo judged, as <hi>T. L.</hi> would have it, then did they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict their own judgements.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, where he ſaith, That neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles did require any to be baptized, but ſuch as did profeſſe to have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith, and ſo making the contradiction to lie in them that profeſſed they had it, and had it not. <hi>T. L.</hi> here ſpeaks, as if indeed Chriſt and his Apoſtles did enjoyne the people to make ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion when they were to be baptized, elſe they might not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and ſo enjoyne them to profeſſe a lie, and themſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it, and ſo judge upon their profeſſion: which is very falſe and wicked for any to ſpeake or think. Neither was Chriſt or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſo unwiſe, as to judge or conclude in their minds, upon ſuch an uncertain profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>For although there were ſome that had juſtifying Faith, were true Iſraelits, ſuch as worſhipped God and wrought righteouſnes, as <hi>Nathanael</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the Eunuch, <hi>Lydia,</hi> &amp;c. who might give ſuch teſtimony of that pretious peculiar faith, as that (although they were not yet ſo much as Diſciples of Chriſt) both Chriſt and his Apoſtles might (and that truly) ſo judge of them. And when they had preached Chriſt now come, and his Goſpel unto them, and they gladly receiving it, they might baptize them, which before they might not, though they had juſtifying Faith, and that they knew it. Although I ſay, theſe could give ſuch a teſtimonie of that ſpeciall faith, as that not only Chriſt, but alſo his Apoſtles after him, could rightly judge of it; yet was it not the rule for outward baptiſme, neither did they, nor could they ſo judge of all whom they baptized; neither did they require ſuch a profeſſion from them as <hi>T. L.</hi> would have it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, whereas <hi>T. L.</hi> ſaith, that although Chriſt did not take it for granted, nor ſo judge, yet the Apoſtles did; which to prove, he quotes <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.7. the words are theſe, <hi>Even as it is meet for me to think of you all.</hi> Whereby T.

                     <p>For the Apoſtle, he directing his Epiſtle eſpecially to the Saints, (as his uſuall manner was to all other Churches) ſo unto the Saints in <hi>Philippi,</hi> of whoſe fruit hee had had good experience, judgeth confidently of many, thinks well of all that he writes to, and ſayes of others clean contrary, <hi>For many walke, of whom I have told you often,

                        <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that as <hi>Luke</hi> affirmes of his Faith, ſo he affirmes of his being in the gall of bitterneſſe, and in the bond of iniquitie.</p>
                        <p>As the ſtate of being in the gall of bitterneſſe, and in the bond of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, doth not preſent a perſon a fit ſubject for baptiſme in Lukes eſteem, no more doth ſuch a Faith as doth not diſtinguiſh a perſon from ſuch a one.

                  <p>If Chriſt and his Apoſtles knew that there were and would be in the Church ſuch beleeving Diſciples baptized according to the rule of Chriſt, as would be like the ſtony and thorny ground, as well as good ground, hypocrites, and ſuch as would offend the little ones that beleeved in Chriſt, and deſpiſe him, hold hereſies, &amp;c. and that it muſt needs be ſo, that they which are approved may be known: Then did not Chriſt nor his Apoſtles judge and account all that were and would be in the Church, to be of the little ones that beleeved in Chriſt, of the approved ones.</p>

                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:155141:8"/>Secondly, we muſt diſtinguiſh between being, and what poſſibly they might be, and the Apoſtles judgement in relation to both.</p>

                     <p>Laſtly, we are to diſtinguiſh of the perſons in reſpect of the time of their comming for baptiſme, and the time of their continuance in the Church. Theſe things thus premiſed, the anſwer is eaſie.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that Chriſt knowing things infallibly, did not account of all that were admitted into the Church by baptiſme, to be true beleevers; and approved, and yet no rule to baptize any other but ſuch as were ſo judged when they were admitted, by them that admitted them, and none of the places alledged doe prove the contrary.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtles indeed might judge that thoſe whom they conceived to have juſtifying faith according to probabilitie, might poſſibly be deſtitute of it according to certainty.</p>

                     <p>There will be falſe brethren, falſe teachers, hypocrites, ſuch as hold hereſies, ſtony ground, thorny ground, covetous perſons, lovers of this preſent world, proud, boaſters, lovers of pleaſures more then lovers of God, carnall corrupt perſons, whoſe belly is their God, minding earthly things, having eys full of adultery, contentious, &amp;c.</p>

                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:155141:8"/>And alſo of Gods elect, ſome yet remaining, like ſome of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer &amp; of them unregenerate, and ſome regenerate ſanctified ones ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by faith in Ieſus Chriſt, whom the holy Ghoſt calleth, good ground, trees of righteouſneſſe, the children of wiſedome, the children of God, the called of God in Ieſus Chriſt, beloved of God, Saints by calling, ſanctified in Ieſus Chriſt, the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of truth, the body and ſpouſe of Chriſt, living ſtones built on Ieſus Chriſt, the chief corner ſtone; a ſpirituall houſe, a Kingly Prieſthood which doe offer up ſpirituall ſacrifices acceptable to God by Ieſus Chriſt: and of whom Chriſt ſaith, <hi>And upon this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For although the other evill ſorts are altogether with theſe, in the outward ſtate of the Church, partaking with them in common things, yet theſe onely properly and truly, ſpiritually and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, are the Church of the living God, his Temple and Tabernacle. And to this Church doe all the moſt ſpeciall peculiar priviledges and treaſures, graces, gifts, and promiſes belong.</p>
                     <p>And when the Apoſtles wrote their Epiſtles to the ſeverall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Churches, as that of <hi>Rome, Corinth,</hi> and the reſt, they directed them chiefly to theſe who were beloved of God, called to be Saints, ſanctified in Chriſt Ieſus, as appeareth plainly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.2. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.1.4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. Although they did not ſever them by name, nor by perſon from the other diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they knew them not, all, from the other, nor the moſt of them; yet ſome they did know, and named them diſtinctly by name, as may be inſtanced.</p>
                     <p>So that in this manner did Chriſt and his Apoſtles judge of the Church, and diſtinguiſh in their judgements, and ſo ought we to doe by their example and rule.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt did not give us a rule, nor a gift, to know all things as he knew all things; but he hath given, and doth give to his Miniſters and Servants, and Saints, rules and examples, and gifts, whereby to underſtand his word, whereby to walk, whereby to judge righteous judgement: but no rule, nor example, nor gift, to judge ſhort of it, or above it, to judge unrighteous judgement.</p>
                     <p>And whereas <hi>T. L.</hi> ſaith, that the Apoſtles indeed might judge thoſe whom they conceived to have juſtifying faith according to probabilitie, might poſſibly bee deſtitute of it according to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:155141:9"/>By this he would ſeem to ſpeak ſomewhat more favourably of the Apoſtles, but indeed makes them as ignorant, faulty and corrupt in their judgments and judgings, as the hypocriticall Jewes, as they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this time, as our high Commiſſion Court that lately was, as himſelfe, for they all as well as he, could iudge upon conceivings and probabilities, ſometimes right, ſometimes wrong, poſſibly they might condemne a juſt man &amp; innocent, and ſet free a murderer; and poſſibly they might doe otherwiſe. But no certaine righteous iudgment will <hi>T.L.</hi> allow the Apoſtles more then theſe, and himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>So that the Apoſtles are nothing at all beholding to T.L. for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable conceit of them. If the Apoſtles judgements had been no ſounder, there was ſmall reaſon then, that they ſhould be ſo credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as they were, eſpecially of the children of wiſdome. But it was otherwiſe, they judged righteous judgement, and underſtood what they ſaid and did.</p>
                     <p>And whereas T. L. among his many diſtinctions ſaith, wee are to diſtinguiſh between being, and what poſſibly may be, and of perſons in reſpect of the time of their comming for Baptiſme, and the time of their continuance.</p>
                     <p>I aske him, If ſuch a diſtinction be to be made; which I grant, ſo it be rightly done, why then, he did not diſtinguiſh between the time of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> beleeving, and being baptized, and the time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when he would have given the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> money for the gift of the holy Ghoſt, and between his beleeving, and this action from his mouth, whereby he diſcovered his heart unto <hi>Peter,</hi> but ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to invent without any diſtinction of time, or condition of ſtate, ſuch a wicked argument againſt the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke,</hi> and ſo againſt <hi>Philip,</hi> and the truth it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>And as concerning the latter part of his anſwer, where he ſaith, that although there were contentions in the Church, and ſo a great fault in the generall, ſo concluded by the Apoſtle, yet not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned who were the particulars alwayes that cauſed the ſame, might leave the ſearch of that to the Congregation, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>He in theſe words admits unto the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> to judge ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better then upon conceiving and probabilitie, when he ſpake of faults in the generall, and of ſome in particular, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And ſo T.L. goes on, telling how the Church is to proceed in brotherly admonition, &amp;c. which becauſe it is not any thing to the queſtion in hand, I leave it till ſome other occaſion. Onely I aske
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:155141:9"/>
T. L. upon his laſt words, why he will have no repentance after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, ſeeing <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to repent of his ſinne after his Baptiſme; is T. L. one that will have no acknowledging nor ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forgiveneſſe of ſinnes after juſtification, he holds all juſtified whom he baptizes, therefore it is probable, though they may prove but a Church of hypocriticall Phariſees, like other falſe Churches, when he hath all done.</p>

                  <p>If to judge after the outward appearance, be to judge like the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall Jewes, and not to judge righteous judgement; Then is not ſuch kinde of judging after the outward appearance, the rule which Chriſt gave to his Church to judge by.</p>
                  <p>But to judge after the outward appearance, is to judge like the hypocriticall Jews, and not to judge righteous judgement, as Chriſt declareth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.24. Therefore ſuch kinde of judging is not the rule which Chriſt gave to his Church to judge by.</p>

                     <head>The Anſwer of T. L.</head>
                     <p>I Anſwer, Wee muſt diſtinguiſh upon outward appearance, for it muſt not be that we muſt not judge the tree by the fruit, nor the heart by the words of the mouth, for that were to contradict the Scriptures, <hi>Rom. 10.9, 10.</hi> and to make Chriſt contrary to himſelfe, <hi>Mat. 7.16.20.

                     <p>The latter outward appearance, is not the rule in which reſpect I grant your Argument true. The former outward appearance is the rule which Chriſt give to his Church to judge by, and your Argument hath no proofe to the contrary.</p>

                        <hi>T. L.</hi> anſwers by diſtinguiſhing ſtill as his manner hath been, and ſaith, we muſt diſtinguiſh upon outward appearance, &amp;c. Whereas Chriſt condemns all judging after the outward appearance, to be an unrighteous kinde of judging, and requires all judgement to be according to truth and righteouſnes, admitting no errour or fayling
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:155141:10"/>
in judging at all. So that there is no diſtinction to be made between judging after the outward appearance, and judging after the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, no more then there is between being a Jew onely outwardly, and being a Jew onely outwardly.</p>
                     <p>But T. L. grants the argument true from the place alledged, and refuſeth that kinde of judging to be the rule: The former which he mentioneth from <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.16.20. to judg the tree by the fruit, and the heart by the words of the mouth; this he accounts to be the rule, but would by his diſtinguiſhing make it a judging after the outward appearance alſo; and, ſo in ſubſtance, no more righteous judgement then the other which Chriſt condemns; for no doubt he will have it to agree with that kind of judging which he hath ſtrove to maintaine all this while. Thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.16.20. I doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and hold to be the rule that Chriſt hath given to his Church and children of wiſdome, to judge the heart of man by, and that it is a moſt true and perfect rule, whereby they may and ſhall know a falſe Prophet, and alſo a true, a true Chriſtian and alſo a falſe, but no rule for Baptiſme.</p>
                     <p>And although the words are plaine, that they ſhall know them by their fruit, as certainly as men doe know a good tree and a bad tree by their fruit, yet it will not be ſo underſtood by T. L. he will diſtinguiſh upon knowing as he did upon outward appearance, and make it but a thinking, or a conceiving, or a knowing probably at the moſt (which is no knowing at all:) for he will have it agree with that which he had ſaid before in his anſwer to the fift argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, theſe words; <hi>The Apoſtles indeed might judge that thoſe whom they conceived to have juſtifying faith, according to probalitie, might poſſibly be deſtitute of it according to certainty;</hi> and ſo make it like this.</p>
                     <p>But there is no marvelling at T. L. herein, for there be many that will concurre with him in this opinion of his, becauſe (although e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man hath the gift, and can know and judge a good tree, and a bad tree by their fruit, and that certainly) for a man cannot be ſaid to know that to be which is not certainly ſo; yet the gift of knowing the fruit of a man, and the heart by the fruit (the words which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the good or evill treaſure of his heart) is not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. This gift is a ſpeciall gift, peculiar to the children of Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome onely.</p>
                     <p>For who did know and judge rightly of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and of Chriſt by their fruit, the words that proceeded out of their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:155141:10"/>
mouthes, and juſtified that excellent wiſedome from above, which they ſpake and uttered, but the children of wiſedom? as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>But wiſedome is juſtified of her children,</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.19. So here, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruits, Doe men gather grapes of thornes, or figges of thiſtles? Even ſo every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evill fruit.</hi> And concludes, <hi>Wherefore by their fruits ye ſhall know them; Ye,</hi> ſaith the Lord, he doth not ſay, every man, nor the wiſe and prudent of the world, but <hi>ye,</hi> even they, and onely they, for whom he gave thankes unto God, ſaying, <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt ſhewed them to Babes, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 11.25. thoſe whom he had (a little before) ſo often pronounced <hi>Bleſſed, Matth.</hi> 5. and now in this place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. fore-warneth them of falſe Prophets that ſhould ariſe and come unto them in ſheeps clothing, but inwardly were ravening wolves, ſuch as if it were poſſible, ſhould deceive even the very elect, and ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruit;</hi> know them and that certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, otherwiſe it cannot be knowing, neither could it availe them.</p>
                     <p>And if any man ſhall object the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> againſt this, where he ſaith, <hi>What man knoweth the things of a man, but the ſpirit of man which is in him? Even ſo the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. and ſay, here the Apoſtle ſeemeth to make it a thing impoſſible for one man to know the things of another mans heart, but his own ſpirit which is in him: Even ſo the things of God, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, It is true, the Apoſtle doth not onely ſeem, but he ſaith it plainly, as a thing whereof no man is ignorant: <hi>For what man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>knoweth the things of a man? &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But we are to conſider his words that follow, <hi>Now we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not the ſpirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God, which things alſo we ſpeak not in the words that mans wiſedome teacheth, but which the holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing ſpirituall things with ſpirituall things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the naturall man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhnes to him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. But he that is ſpirituall, judgeth all things, yet he himſelfe is judged of no man,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
                     <p>By which words the Apoſtle removeth the objection quite, and ſheweth, that although it be true, that the naturall man knoweth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:155141:11"/>
not, nor can diſcern the things of man, much leſſe the things of God, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned; yet the ſpirituall man, they that are ſpirituall, having the Spirit of God, the mind of Chriſt, they can, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y both know God and Chriſt, and the things of God, by the words which proceed out of his mouth; and they know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the things of man by the words that come forth of his mouth from the good or evill treaſure of his heart: for from <hi>out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the heart the mouth ſpeakes,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.45. And ſo by their fruit they can and doe know them, which the naturall man cannot poſſibly doe.</p>
                     <p>This is the rule that Chriſt hath given to his Church and choſen people, the humble and meek (who have received his Spirit) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to know a falſe Prophet, and alſo a true, a falſe-hearted Chriſtian brother, and alſo a true, when they diſcover their hearts by their words, which ſome time or other they cannot but doe, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p>But this is not the rule for outward baptiſme, as T. L. would make it, Chriſt did not enjoyne his Apoſtles and Miniſters thus to know and judge of the hearts of men before they baptized them. Nay, then they might as well lay their hands on them alſo before it, in approbation of them, which was alwayes performed after baptiſme.</p>
                     <p>Neither did <hi>Philip</hi> ſo know and judge of the hearts of them of Samaria, whom he baptized, whereof <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was one, yet he judged rightly of them all; he ſaw and knew that they beleeved ſo farre in that kind, as made them meet for outward baptiſme; even <hi>Simon Magus</hi> as well as the reſt, and did not lay his hands on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, but left them ſo, till their fruit might make them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
                     <p>But after ſome time had paſſed, and that <hi>Peter</hi> was come to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, and having ſearched them, and finding the hearts of ſome of them right in the ſight of God, he approving them, laid his hands on them, and they received the gift of the holy Ghoſt. But finding the heart of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to be otherwiſe, he rejected him, onely reproves him, and bids him repent of his wickedneſſe, &amp;c. So <hi>Peter</hi> tried them throughly, and did not lay his hands ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly on any of them, according to which alſo <hi>Paul</hi> practiſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.5.6. and ſo chargeth <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. and ſo the order of theſe principles of Chriſt, is ſet down and deſcribed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. and ſo the Apoſtles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:155141:11"/>
in their time preached and practiſed according as Chriſt gave them example, order and rule, preaching as he did, ſaying, <hi>The Kingdome of God is at hand, repent ye, and beleeve the Goſpel, Mark</hi> 1.15. according to that which he ſpake, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. <hi>And that repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes ſhould be preached in his name among all Nations, beginning at Jeruſalem, verſ.</hi> 47. For theſe are the firſt principles of Chriſt the doctrine of Baptiſmes, which whoſoever did beleeve, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto, and gladly receive, became Diſciples, and were baptized with outward baptiſme; and afterward, they that attained to true repentance, and remiſſion of their ſinnes, through faith in his name, and ſhewing forth the fruit thereof, were approved. And therfore Chriſt ſaid unto ſome that beleeved on him in that common kind of beleeving, <hi>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my Diſciples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and yee ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free, Joh.</hi> 8.32, 33. And again, <hi>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away, and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit. If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth, &amp;c.</hi> Ioh. 15.</p>
                     <p>By all which it is manifeſt, that ſuch a beleeving on Chriſt as the former, which onely maketh a man a Diſciple fit for outward bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, ſuch a graffing into the vine availeth nothing, if he attaine not to true repentance in his own heart, and to the faith that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love, that bringeth forth good fruit from his heart, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be approved in the ſight of God, nor of his Church, God will cut him off as a branch, and withered.</p>
                     <p>Therfore, I ſay, it is no marvelling greatly at T. L. that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how to judge righteous iudgement, he being, (as well as many thouſands more are) deſtitute of thoſe ſpeciall peculiar graces and gifts of the Spirit, whereby to know it, and ſo iudge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now I put a queſtion to T.L. which is this, That if without all contradiction, <hi>the leſſer is bleſſed of the greater,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.7. And that the Elders that were ordained in the Apoſtles time, were ordained by the approbation and laying on of hands of the Apoſtles and Elders, who were in thoſe heavenly reſpects grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then they on whom they laid their hands; Then where and who that greater is that did ſo ordain him, I mean T. L. that placed him in the Chaire, and gave him power to make Diſciples, baptize, plant Churches, and taught him ſo to iudge as he ſpeaks? If he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:155141:12"/>
ſhew that greater, like ſome of thoſe before mentioned, nor a greater then they that did ſo ordain him, &amp; place him, and give him authoritie and power to doe al thoſe things: If he cannot doe this, I ſay, then is he not ſo neere like the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> as he profeſſeth himſelfe to be; but ſheweth himſelfe to be a very bold preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, in taking ſo much upon him; and his ſinne in this is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his opinion of ignorance concerning the Rule before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of: of which with this I adviſe him to repent, and ſo farewell.</p>

                  <p>But the leaſt thing that was then to diſtinguiſh little children from the heathen and uncircumciſed, was the circumciſion in the fleſh; and the leaſt thing that can now diſtinguiſh a little child from the heathen and unbaptized, is outward baptiſme.

                     <p>And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> by another commandement in the Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the corn,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that thoſe Meſſengers and Miniſters of God, that tread out, or preach unto us the word of the Goſpel, ought to be provided for,

                     <p>Again, if little children may not be baptized, becauſe there is no plain word requiring it, nor example mentioned that by name they were: Then neither may women partake of the Lords Supper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not a word requiring it, nor an example plainly ſet down, that women by name did. Now, who dares be ſo bold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude they may not?

And beſides, it is as probable, that if little children were not to bee baptized, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> at leaſt, (mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them by the names of whole houſhold, &amp; all his houſe) would, then, have ſaid, Except little children.</p>
                     <p>And conſidering alſo that the name Houſhold, Houſe, Family, doth, and did then eſpecially, properly intend and imply children, as the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the houſe of <hi>David, I and my Houſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua) will ſerve the Lord,</hi> where, by their houſe, is meant their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and off-ſpring. And a man may be ſaid, as the Keeper of the Priſon was, to beleeve with all his houſe, though a little child were in it, becauſe it is underſtood that a little child cannot beleeve, and needs not therefore to be excepted in reſpect of beleeving, and yet be baptized.</p>
                     <p>And ſeldome is there a houſhold or family that hath not ſome children in it, or a child at leaſt; ſo that here is great probabilitie, that children were baptized, or at leaſt might be, ſeeing they were no where excepted. And the promiſe which God made unto the faithfull Fathers of old, as touching their children, of ſhewing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie unto them, of calling a ſeed in them, ſtandeth as faſt now to the

                  <p>But Chriſt did never take away any of the former priviledges of the little children of the faithfull; neither did he himſelfe, nor any of his Apoſtles ever forbid little children to be baptized, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the outward ſtate of the Church now in this time of the Goſpel: Therefore no man may dare to doe it.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoever ſhall preſume to doe this thing, ſeeing that neither

Chriſt nor any of his Apoſtles ever did it, ſheweth himſelfe to be a very bold preſumptuous ſpirit, taking upon him above Chriſt and all his Apoſtles; and ſinneth alſo greatly, having not faith in the action.</p>

                  <p>I ask T.

For if it be a matter of ſo great conſequence, as without which there can bee no true refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from the Antichriſtian Church, to become a true Church of Chriſt, as you perſwade the people.

                  <p>Chriſt gave a rule unto his Diſciples for prayer, and commanded ſaying, <hi>When ye pray, ſay, Our Father which art in heaven, &amp;c.</hi> I ask the reaſon why you doe not when you pray, perform it, according to the words, ſeeing they are ſo plainly written down, and yet charge the other ſo as ye do upon the people, without either word or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample?</p>
                  <p>Again, Chriſt performed a work in waſhing his Diſciples feet, and commanded them that they ſhould ſo waſh one anothers feet, as he had given them example: What is the reaſon ye take not this work in hand to practiſe it, ſeeing the commandement, and every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and action that Chriſt performed, is ſo plainly written down, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.4, 5, 6, and ſo to verſe 17.</p>

                  <p>All theſe things have already thus farre paſſed and proceeded: otherwiſe that reformation which is and hath been within thoſe yeares (of Kingdoms and Cities, and peoples revolt from the Beaſt and his Church (that mother of harlots and abominations of the earth) w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have ſeen, read, and heard of; and which coſt the lives of ſo many thouſands that teſtified and maintained the truth of Gods two witneſſes againſt them) had not been.

Neither doe nor did their bodies lie dead and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried in the Church of the Saints at any time, though they were never ſo few, or never ſo diſperſt into the deſart or wilderneſſe, they alwayes retained them alive and propheſying, but yet in ſackcloth with much oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>And for any Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Men or Angels, to be the two witneſſes, or equall with them, is not poſſible, neither may ſuch an opinion be admitted or thought of: for what creature, or creatures in heaven or earth, may or can be ſaid to empty the golden oyle out of themſelves into the golden Candleſtick, which is the Church of God, whereof his true Miniſters are part, but onely the two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, thoſe two Olive branches, and two ſpeciall Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtickes, being both one, which alwayes ſtood before the ruler of the whole earth, as well in the Prophet <hi>Zacharies</hi> time, and before it, as now ſince, who have the golden oyle in themſelves naturally, as the Olive trees have their oyle, and doe hold forth their light to all the world, as in <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>And who may be ſaid to ſmite the earth with all maner of plagues ſo often as they will, but they? if they ſay the word, it is done. All that the holy Prophets and Apoſtles have ſpoken and written, was their word and teſtimony, not their own: Therefore the Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them his <hi>two Witneſſes, Rev.</hi> 11.3. <hi>And I will give unto my two Witneſſes, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe they are his own word, according as the holy
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:155141:17"/>
Angel anſwered the Prophet <hi>Zachariah,</hi> when he deſired to know what they were ſaying, <hi>This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, ſaying, Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. Who art thou, O thou great Mountain, &amp;c. Zach.</hi> 4.6, 7. Neither may any Miniſter of God, Apoſtle, Prophet, or Angel, ſay or think, when he writeth or ſpeaketh the things of God, that he writeth or ſpeaketh his own words: Neither may any man in the name of the Lord ſpeak his own words, but if he ſpeak in his name, he ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to ſpeak as the Oracles of God, as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Therefore have I cut them down by my Prophets, and ſlain them with the words of my mouth.</hi> So then, the two witneſſes being the two Teſtaments of God, which are his two Candleſtickes alſo, that carry in them the light of his truth, and power of his Spirit, which the Beaſt at his riſing had killed, but are now come to life again, even the Spirit and life of Gods own word, whereby alſo he made the worlds, which name belongs onely to him who ſitteth on the white horſe, <hi>The Lamb</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>the Branch, the Stone</hi> that hath the <hi>ſeven Eyes,</hi> which are the ſeven Spirits of God, ſent out into all the world, ſpoken of in <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.8.9. and 4.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Even that head Stone,</hi> which <hi>Zerubabel</hi> was to bring forth; he that is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who hath the ſharp ſword in his mouth; He, as he hath prevailed thus farre againſt the Beaſt and his Armies, ſo he ſhall go on and proſper in his war, let the Beaſt and the Kings of the earth with their armies gather themſelves together againſt him and his Armies, and doe what they can the Beaſt ſhall not recover out of his conſumption, he muſt be taken, and with him the falſe prophet, his Clergy that wrought miracles before him, and both be caſt alive into the lake of fire, burning with brimſtone. And thoſe Kings of the earth, and the reſt of his armies, be ſlain with the ſword of him that ſits on the white horſe, which comes out of his mouth, &amp;c. as the Lord hath ſpoken, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For who art thou, O thou great Mountain Babel,</hi> before him? Thou alſo ſhalt become a plain like all thy predeceſſors, and Monarchs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee. <hi>The man whoſe name is the Branch,</hi> he hath laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the houſe of God, and he ſhall finiſh it even to the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>And now as hitherto the Lord by his word of truth, the golden oyle of his two Olive trees, with which through his holy Spirit, he hath lighted his golden Candleſtick in her ſeven Lamps, ſo that ſhe can, and hath of late, held forth the ſame again in ſome meaſure,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:155141:17"/>
to the world, whereby the abominations of Antichriſt and his Church, hath been in part diſcovered from day to day, to this preſennt. And as their glory decayeth, ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſhall the face of her, the Lords true Church, by degrees be ſeen more and more to ſhine in her true ſpirituall light and beautie, untill ſhe come neereſt like unto the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ſtate that ſhe, in this laſt corrupt age of the world, can come to, which upon the full end and deſolation of the Beaſt and his Church, will be.</p>
                  <p>Then many things which now remaine even to ſome of Gods choſen ſervants, hid and obſcure (though foretold in Scripture) ſhall bee knowne, and underſtood. Then ſhall ſhee, the true Church indeed, come clean forth of that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of her ſecret reſting place, where ſhee had been fed ſo long, and be farre more viſible then now ſhee is. She will not be divided into ſo many Sects as now are, of thoſe that falſly take on them her name, having ſo many ſeverall inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Leaders, as there are independent Sects; and as many Sects, as every one that will riſe to draw Diſciples after him, can (by ſpeaking perverſe things unto them) make. Nay, ſhe ſhall be as ſhe alwayes hath been in ſuch reſpects (and is) undivided, though diſperſt, holding faith and truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confuſion or diviſion; yet not without ſome perſecution and affliction, which as the Lord fore-told her, muſt bee a part of her portion in this world.</p>
                  <p>And although ſhe may, and ſhall, in reſpect of her ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places of abode, be diſtinguiſhed by the names of the places, yet ſhall ſhe not be divided, nor any one part inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent from the other, nor from the whole, no more then the parts &amp; members of one body are; nor one part ſay or think of another, I have no need of thee, no more then the members of one body may.</p>
                  <p>Neither ſhall they bee free from all kind of dependancie on the Magiſtracie, or State where they are. But as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in place of authoritie, are in duty bound to have ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care of the glory, worſhip and ſervice of God, and to ſee that he be not diſhonored by Idolatry, ſuperſtition, or any blaſphemous, erronious, Antichriſtian doctrines, nor any kind
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:155141:18"/>
of abominations, or groſſe wickedneſſes, leſt they (by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or permitting the ſame upon knowledge) be found guilty of their ſinne, and periſh with them. And alſo to ſee that the Church, as well as the State, be ordered and ſo ſetled in a forme of goverment according to the word of God, and ſo protected and defended by them, that all the people may peaceably be taught in the wayes of truth and ſalvation. So the Church and Children of God are bound to ſubmit and bee obedient.</p>
                  <p>And although they are free and independent from men, in all ſpirituall things concerning God and their owne Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; not having in ſuch reſpects, any ſupreme Head, Ruler, or Teacher over them, but Chriſt their Lord, nor may (So) call any man on earth, Lord, becauſe one is their Lord, nor any man Doctor, becauſe one is their Doctor, even He, the Lord himſelfe, who hath appointed no one in his ſtead, during the time of his perſonall abſence, ſo to bee over his Church, but his holy Spirit onely, the Spirit of truth, the Comforter, which he hath ſent, and is with his Church to the worlds end, to rule and governe it, to teach and guide her, and all her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the wayes of truth, as being the great moderator of all his ſpirituall matters; yet are they not therefore free from all dependencie on the Magiſtracie, or State.</p>
                  <p>But if they ſhall falle in their duties before mentioned, and doe, and command things contrary, as hath been hitherto moſt commonly in all Kingdomes and States in the world: Then are the Children free, and not bound to obey, but rather to ſuffer unto death; they are to give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and unto God the things that are Gods, as Chriſt hath commanded.</p>
                  <p>This Church, if ever it come ſo neere the primitive ſtate, as is hoped upon good ground it will, ſhee will be ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in every part where ſhe ſhall be, ſo ſevered and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht, that if one brother treſpaſſe againſt another, and will not bee reconciled, it may bee knowne where to goe and tell it to the Church, according to the Rule of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. which Church if the treſpaſſer ſhall refuſe to heare, hee is then to be unto his brother in account as a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:155141:18"/>
and a Publican: For of this Church and her children it was that Chriſt ſpake when he ſaid, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven. verſ.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>And therefore hee ſaith againe, <hi>If two of you ſhall agree on earth</hi> (he ſaith not any two in the outward ſtate of the Church) But <hi>Two of you,</hi> meaning of his truly faithfull ones) as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing that they ſhall ask, <hi>it ſhall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven: For where two or three are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For although there are and will be many within the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate and pale of the Church, that are not truly faithfull, that are not of her in reſpect of her inward ſpirituall ſtate of true Repentance, juſtifying Faith, power of the Spirit, Wiſedome from above: Chriſt ſpeakes not here unto them, nor of them; they, though they bee never ſo great in place and power externall, and wiſedome naturall, have nothing to doe with theſe excellent treaſures.</p>
                  <p>They have no part with the Spouſe herſelfe therein, it is to her and her children alone, that Chriſt hath promiſed, given, and will give thoſe ſpeciall peculiar graces, and thoſe keyes of the Kingdome of heaven, that whatſoever they ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven, as he alſo declared, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. verſ. 18, 19. Neither is the Prince or Magiſtrate, having the ſame grace, exempted from theſe priviledges, becauſe he is in place of authoritie; but rather the more to be honoured that way.</p>
                  <p>This Church, I ſay, ſhall now daily (in reſpect of her light of Faith and Truth, and other graces and gifts of the Spirit) increaſe, and by the word of Gods two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and power of his Spirit, wherewith hee hath, and will repleniſh her, ſhall not onely convince the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people, and wicked periſhing World, of ſinne, of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and of judgement; but alſo, and more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the ſame Word of Truth, and power of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, bring forth and accompliſh all her owne children, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the full number of Gods elect, the generation of his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:155141:19"/>
firſt-borne, which within the very time of this preſent laſt age, will bee fully perfected, as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> declareth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.12.13. according to the words of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.29. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.14.</p>
                  <p>For as the true eſtate of the primitive Church of Chriſt, laſted but a ſhort time before the Dragon raiſed his great perſecution againſt her and her Child, the firſt fruits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhee was then in travell to bee delivered, by which meanes ſhee was inforced to flie into the Wilderneſſe, and ſo the great light of her bright ſhining graces, ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then clothed with the Sunne, and having the Moon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her feet, and on her head a Crowne of twelve Starres, (which made her ſo viſible like a Citie ſet upon a Hill, that cannot bee hid; and as a Candle in a Candleſtick, which giveth light to all that are in the houſe) was elipſed, and hidden in obſcuritie, in compariſon of her firſt eſtate, as you may read and perceive, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>So now, after the deſolation of Antichriſt, which is now neere at hand, the time will bee as ſhort wherein her light ſhall (in a meaſure) ſo ſhine againe; and ſhee ſhall travell to bring forth her laſt fruits unto God, and to the Lamb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Dragon, the Devill, Satan, who (in reſpect of his former practices, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. and before) hee hath been ſo long time bound) ſhall bee looſed again out of his priſon, and goe unto the Kings of the earth, and of the whole World, to deceive the Nations that are in the foure quarters of the Earth, even <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and gather them together, and bring them downe, in number like the ſand of the Sea, and compaſſe the Camp of the Saints about, and the beloved Citie; and ſo (for a little ſeaſon) greatly trouble her, even till fire ſhall come down from God out of heaven, and devoure them, as it is written, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.7.8.9. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.39. chapters.</p>
                  <p>And then the Lord JESUS CHRIST will come in his glory, and all his holy Angels with him, and then he ſhall ſit in the throne of his glory; and all the dead, both good and bad, ſhall bee raiſed, and with the living bee brought before him, and hee will ſeparate the Sheep from the Goats, the Books
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:155141:19"/>
ſhall bee opened, and they ſhall bee judged every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his workes, as it is written, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31, 31, 32, 33, 34, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.11, 12, 13, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And ſo the judgement being paſſed, and the corrupt ſtate of this world diſſolved, there ſhall bee new heavens, and a new earth, and the holy Citie, new Jeruſalem, the Bride, the Lambs wife, ſhall bee manifeſted from heaven in her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect glory with all her children, according as it is often in Scripture foretold of her, <hi>Eſay</hi> 49.14, 15, &amp;c. <hi>Eſay</hi> 60. <hi>Eſay</hi> 65. <hi>Eſay</hi> 66. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. and 22.</p>
                  <p>The whole houſe of Iſrael, all Gods elect and choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all Nations and times, ſhall now bee perfectly and fully delivered from all their captivities and troubles, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, teares, graves, duſt, and ſhall ſorrow and weep no more, as the Lord hath promiſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4. and ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places.
